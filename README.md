This repository also contains internal code of kmeans  
This also contains applied code on NYC Yellow Taxi Trip data
This also contains a code for a special exercise : The main task of the exercise is that I have to design a simple web based app (This is in streamlit) where user can upload an image and we have to give out the top 5 major used colors.
